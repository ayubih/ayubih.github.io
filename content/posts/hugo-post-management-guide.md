## Introduction

Hugo is a powerful static site generator that makes content management straightforward and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn everything about creating, editing, and managing blog posts in Hugo, from basic commands to advanced techniques.

## Understanding Hugo Content Structure

Before diving into post management, let's understand how Hugo organizes content:

```text
your-hugo-site/
├── content/
│   ├── posts/           # Blog posts directory
│   │   ├── post1.md
│   │   └── post2.md
│   ├── about.md         # Single pages
│   └── _index.md        # Section index pages
├── static/              # Static assets (images, files)
├── themes/              # Hugo themes
└── hugo.yaml           # Site configuration
```

## Creating New Posts

### Method 1: Using Hugo Command (Recommended)

The most efficient way to create new posts is using Hugo's built-in command:

```bash
# Navigate to your Hugo site directory
cd your-hugo-site

# Create a new post
hugo new content posts/my-new-post.md

# Create with specific date
hugo new content posts/weekly-update-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# Create in subdirectory
hugo new content posts/tutorials/advanced-hugo-tips.md
```

**What this command does:**
- Creates a new markdown file in the specified location
- Adds front matter based on your archetype template
- Sets the creation date automatically
- Ensures proper file structure

### Method 2: Manual Creation

You can also create posts manually:

```bash
# Create the file
touch content/posts/manual-post.md

# Or use your preferred editor
nano content/posts/manual-post.md
code content/posts/manual-post.md
```

**Note:** Manual creation requires you to add front matter yourself.

## Understanding Front Matter

Front matter is metadata at the beginning of your post that tells Hugo how to process the content:

### YAML Front Matter (Recommended)
```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-08-26T19:45:00-05:00
draft: false
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
categories: ["category1"]
author: "Your Name"
description: "SEO-friendly description of your post"
showToc: true
cover:
  image: "images/cover.jpg"
  alt: "Cover image description"
  caption: "Image caption"
weight: 10
---
```

### TOML Front Matter
```toml
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = 2025-08-26T19:45:00-05:00
draft = false
tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
categories = ["category1"]
+++
```

### JSON Front Matter
```json
{
  "title": "Your Post Title",
  "date": "2025-08-26T19:45:00-05:00",
  "draft": false,
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

## Essential Front Matter Fields

### **Required Fields**
- `title`: Post title (appears in browser tab, social shares)
- `date`: Publication date (affects sorting and URLs)

### **Important Fields**
- `draft`: `true` = hidden, `false` = published
- `description`: SEO meta description
- `tags`: Topical keywords for categorization
- `categories`: Broader content groupings
- `author`: Post author name

### **PaperMod Theme Specific**
- `showToc`: Enable table of contents
- `weight`: Custom ordering (lower = higher priority)
- `cover`: Cover image configuration
- `ShowReadingTime`: Display estimated reading time

## Creating Different Types of Posts

### **Blog Post Template**
```bash
hugo new content posts/blog-post.md
```

## Editing Existing Posts

### **Finding Posts to Edit**
```bash
# List all posts
ls -la content/posts/

# Search for specific posts
find content/posts -name "*keyword*"

# Show posts with their dates
ls -lt content/posts/
```

### **Common Editing Tasks**

#### **Update Post Metadata**
```bash
# Open post in editor
code content/posts/existing-post.md

# Modify front matter
title: "Updated Title"
tags: ["new-tag", "updated-tag"]
lastmod: 2025-08-26T20:00:00-05:00  # Track last modification
```

#### **Change Publication Status**
```yaml
# Unpublish a post
draft: true

# Publish a draft
draft: false

# Schedule for future (Hugo will hide until date)
publishDate: 2025-09-01T10:00:00-05:00
```

#### **Update Content**
- Edit the markdown content below the front matter
- Add new sections, images, or links
- Update outdated information

## Content Organization Strategies

### **Directory Structure**
```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── 2025/
│   │   ├── 01-january/
│   │   └── 02-february/
│   ├── tutorials/
│   ├── reviews/
│   └── quick-tips/
```

### **URL Structure Control**
```yaml
# In front matter
url: "/custom-url-slug/"
slug: "custom-slug"
aliases: 
  - "/old-url/"
  - "/another-old-url/"
```

### **Content Series**
```yaml
# Link related posts
series: ["Hugo Mastery"]
weight: 2  # Order within series
```

## Advanced Post Management

### **Bulk Operations**

#### **Mass Update Tags**
```bash
# Using sed to add tags
find content/posts -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/tags: \[\]/tags: ["general"]/' {} \;

# Using grep and sed for conditional updates
grep -l "tutorial" content/posts/*.md | xargs sed -i 's/categories: \[\]/categories: ["tutorials"]/'
```

#### **Update All Dates**
```bash
# Update all posts to today's date (be careful!)
find content/posts -name "*.md" -exec sed -i "s/date: .*/date: $(date -Iseconds)/" {} \;
```

### **Content Validation**

#### **Check for Draft Posts**
```bash
# Find all drafts
grep -l "draft: true" content/posts/*.md

# Count drafts
grep -c "draft: true" content/posts/*.md
```

#### **Validate Front Matter**
```bash
# Check for missing titles
grep -L "title:" content/posts/*.md

# Find posts without descriptions
grep -L "description:" content/posts/*.md
```

### **Automation Scripts**

#### **New Post Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as new-post.sh

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./new-post.sh 'Post Title'"
    exit 1
fi

SLUG=$(echo "$1" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/ /-/g')
DATE=$(date -Iseconds)

hugo new content "posts/${SLUG}.md"

echo "Created: content/posts/${SLUG}.md"
echo "Opening in editor..."
code "content/posts/${SLUG}.md"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x new-post.sh
./new-post.sh "My Amazing New Post"
```

## Testing and Preview

### **Local Development Server**
```bash
# Start server with drafts
hugo server -D

# Start with specific port
hugo server -p 1314

# Build drafts and future posts
hugo server -D -F

# Fast render mode (for quick edits)
hugo server --disableFastRender
```

### **Build for Production**
```bash
# Clean build
hugo --cleanDestinationDir

# Build with minification
hugo --minify

# Build for specific environment
hugo --environment production
```

### **Content Validation**
```bash
# Check for broken links
hugo server --navigateToChanged

# Validate HTML output
htmlproofer public/

# Check spelling (if available)
aspell check content/posts/your-post.md
```

## Publishing Workflow

### **Complete Publishing Process**

1. **Create/Edit Content**
   ```bash
   hugo new content posts/new-post.md
   # Edit the content
   ```

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   # Visit http://localhost:1313
   ```

3. **Final Review**
   ```bash
   # Set draft to false
   sed -i 's/draft: true/draft: false/' content/posts/new-post.md
   ```

4. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Add to git
   git add content/posts/new-post.md
   
   # Commit with descriptive message
   git commit -m "Add new post: Post Title"
   
   # Push to trigger deployment
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Git Workflow for Posts**
```bash
# Create feature branch for major posts
git checkout -b post/new-feature-guide

# Regular commits as you write
git add content/posts/feature-guide.md
git commit -m "WIP: Add introduction section"

# Final commit and merge
git commit -m "Complete feature guide post"
git checkout main
git merge post/new-feature-guide
git push origin main
```

## Content Backup and Migration

### **Backup Strategy**
```bash
# Backup content directory
tar -czf content-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz content/

# Git-based backup
git clone your-repo.git backup-repo
```

### **Migrating from Other Platforms**

#### **From WordPress**
```bash
# Use wordpress-to-hugo-exporter plugin
# Or jekyll-import with hugo conversion
```

#### **From Markdown Files**
```bash
# Batch convert and move files
for file in source-dir/*.md; do
    hugo new "posts/$(basename "$file")"
    # Merge content manually or with scripts
done
```

## Best Practices

### **Content Organization**

- Keep posts focused and well-structured

### **SEO Optimization**

grep "date:" content/posts/missing-post.md

# Check for syntax errors
hugo --debug
```

### **Date Issues**
```bash
# Fix date format
date: 2025-08-26T19:45:00-05:00  # Correct ISO format
date: "2025-08-26"                # Simple date
```

### **Build Errors**
```bash
# Verbose output
hugo --verbose

# Check for invalid front matter
yaml-lint content/posts/problematic-post.md
```
