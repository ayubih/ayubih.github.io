# Today I Learned

Welcome to my TIL (Today I Learned) section! Here you'll find quick snippets and notes about things I learn in my daily coding and tech journey. These are meant to be short, focused learnings that might be useful to others or serve as my future reference.

Each TIL post captures a specific learning moment - whether it's a new command, a programming concept, a tool tip, or an interesting solution to a problem.
